# Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery
This project aims to practice the steps of Crisp Data Mining ( CRISP-DM ).
The repository includes 3 phases, data understanding, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.

- In P1, data understanding, I practice looking at the data and **checking data quality** by plotting numeric and categorical features. Also, I apply some **preprocessing** methods like **min-max scaling to [0,1]**,  **standardizing the features to 0 mean and unit variance**, and **one-hot coding**.

- In P2, supervised learning, 3 **classification** methods are implemented; **K nearest neighbor (KNN), ride regression, and KNN regression**. For **hyperparameter optimization**, I used **one-leave-out cross-validation**.

- In P3, Unsupervised learning, some preprocessing for data visualization methods are implemented; **z-score standardization**, **principal component analysis (PCA)**, and **dendrograms**. Moreover, two clustering methods are applied; **Agglomerative hierarchical** and **K-means clustering**.
